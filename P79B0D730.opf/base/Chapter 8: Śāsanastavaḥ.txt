Praise of Teaching

Your teaching, and yours alone, is the only path, pleasant in method, goodly in result, free
from moral fault, fair in beginning, middle, and end.

If fools, through attachment to false opinions, contemn your teaching which is so wholly beautiful,
then there is no enemy like false opinion.

Remembering the affliction which you bore for the sake of this world it would be right to follow
your teaching even if it were ugly.

All the more since you are beneficent in deed and word should your teaching in all ways be fulfilled,
even by one whose head is aflame.

Independence, the joy of enlightenment, praise of virtue from you, peace - all these four good
things are gained from your teaching.

This teaching of yours, O Hero, brought terror to all tÄ«rthikas, agony to Namuci, cheer to gods
and men.

Even the ordinance of the Lord of Death, which rules widely over the three worlds without let
or control, has been overcome by your teaching.

For he who knows the rule of your teaching might if he desired live even for an age; but of
his own free will he goes forth to the place where Death cannot tread.

Nowhere except in your teaching is there the threefold division of time into hearing the Scriptures,
thought upon their meaning, and the practice of meditation.

That men do not reverence this teaching of yours so full of good, O Bull among Sages, what is
more calamitous than this?
