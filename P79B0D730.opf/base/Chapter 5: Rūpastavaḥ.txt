Praise of Form

This form of yours, calm yet lovely, brilliant yet not dazzling, modest yet mighty, whom would
it not entrance?

That form of yours pleases the eye of him who has seen it a hundred times and of him who views
it for the first time, both alike.

Because it never satiates the beholder and because of its mild aspect your body gives fresh
delight as often as it is seen.

Your figure has the qualities proper to a receptable, your virtues those proper to an occupant;
by reason whereof both are endowed with the highest excellence and the excellence of each
is adapted to that of the other.

Where else would these virtues of a TathƒÅgata be well housed but in this form of yours, blazing
with signs and marks?

Your form seems to say to the indwelling virtues 'I am fortunate'; and the virtues seem to answer
it 'we are well placed'.
