Introduction

In whom at all times and in all ways all faults are absent and in whom all virtues in every
manner are established, in him it is proper for them that have understanding to take refuge,
to praise him, to serve him, and to stand fast in his teaching.

(See previous verse)

In him, the only Protector, those faults along with their Impressions are wholly absent and
in him, the All-Knower, all those virtues are present, invariable.

For even a spiteful man does not with justice find any failing in the Blessed One whether in
thought, word, or deed.

I, having gained human estate to which belongs the great joy of the Good Law, even as a turtle's
neck might chance to thrust through a yoke hole in the mighty ocean, how shall I not
extract worth from this voice of mine, pervaded as it is with impermanence and beset by dangers
arising from the imperfections of karma.

(See previous verse)

Thus minded, although knowing that the Sage's virtues range beyond calculation, yet I devote
myself to a portion thereof from regard to my own welfare.

Hail to you, the Self-born, whose works are many and wonderful, whose virtues are too numerous
and potent to be defined!

Their number? It is infinite. Their nature? What words for it? But they bring merit, and therefore
I have much to say concerning your virtues.
