Praise of Wonders

Considering the true nature of things I look upon your victory over M훮ra as but a trivial matter,
though all the world is amazed thereby.

For they who rise up to assault, though their fury be great, are not too heavy a load for Patience
to bear, especially when in a worthy vessel.

But your vast slaughter of impurities, accomplished that same night after the conquest of M훮ra,
that is indeed most wonderful.

He who is amazed at the dissipation of darkness by him whose garland is a thousand rays might
wonder, O Hero, at your victory over the t카rthikas.

Three have ever been conquered by three: the passionate by the passionless, the wrathful by
the victor over wrath, the foolish by the free from folly.

You praise good elements, you blame bad elements; but towards good beings and bad you have neither
liking nor disliking.

What praise could be found for you in whose mind was no movement of revulsion or inclination
towards Arhat or t카rthika?

In you was no attachment even to virtues, no desire even towards the virtuous; ah! the supreme
purity of your most tranquil being!

Because of the ever-unaltering calm of your senses your ever-tranquil mind is seen as though
plain to the eye.

Even to the foolish are the purities of your thought and memory well known, being made plain
by the good words and good actions which revealed your nature.
