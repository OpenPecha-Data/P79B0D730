Praise of Arduous Deeds

Fatigue, loss of the pleasure of tranquillity, contact with evil-doers, the Pairs, the press
of the multitude - since, bearing these ills as if they were virtues, you strive for the
world's sake with mind free from attachment, how wonderful is the blessed Buddha-nature of
the Buddhas!

(See previous verse)

You ate even sorry food, accepted hunger sometimes, trod rough paths, slept on mud trampled
by cattle.

Out of love for those to be trained, O Lord, you undertook service attended by insult and changed
your dress and speech, master though you were.

Although you are master, O Lord, you are never found to be so in your own case; for you are
employed as an underling by all at will for their own advantage.

No matter by whom or where or how provoked you do not transgress your fair path of conduct.

Men study not so the welfare even of one who seeks their good as you study that even of one
who seeks your harm.

Towards an enemy intent on ill you are a friend intent on good; even in a constant fault-seeker
you are bent on searching for virtues.

To him whose invitation to you was with poison and fire your coming was with pity and nectar.

You overcame the revilers by patience, the malicious by blessing, by truth the slanderers, by
kindness the injurious.

The manifold natures of men, depraved from time without beginning, were converted instantly
by you, their evil destinies being annulled.
