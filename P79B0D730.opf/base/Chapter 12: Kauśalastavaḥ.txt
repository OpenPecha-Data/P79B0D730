Praise of Skill

That the harsh became gentle, the niggard bountiful, the cruel tenderhearted - this was the
result of your skill in expedients.

Tranquillity of the senses in a Nanda, humility on a Mānastabdha, mercy in an Aṅgulīmāla - whom
would not these amaze?

Leaving a golden couch, many lay happily on beds of grass, steadfast, satisfied with the elixir
of your Law.

Sometimes you spoke not even when questioned; sometimes you yourself accosted others and made
converse; in another case you aroused desire and spoke (later): for you knew times and hearts.

Having first produced mental health by precepts of charity and so forth you then applied the
Law like dye on a clean garment.

There is no expedient or possibility by which you did not try to rescue the miserable world
from the dreadful hell of the saṃsāra.

Many and diverse were the words and actions to which you resorted in one place or another according
to the differing minds of those to be trained;

All pure, amiable, honoured and extolled, salutary and acclaimed by gods and men.

It is impossible both to speak and to act much and well; but in your case, O Truth-teller, both
were found possible.

By your own purity alone you might cleanse the world; therefore there is not to be found in
the three worlds a field such as you; especially since you so rose up for the welfare of all
beings, utterly lost as they were in the perilous strait of existence without beginning.
