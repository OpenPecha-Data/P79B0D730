Praise of Pity

All this world without distinction was bound by the Impurities; you, that you might free the
world from the Impurities, were long in bondage to Pity.

Which shall I first extol, you or the Great Pity by which you were held so long in the saṃsāra,
though knowing its evils so well?

Used though you were to the delight of loneliness, your time was passed among the crowd; this
was brought about by your Pity, given free course.

As a nāga is drawn from his lake by a spell, so are you drawn by Pity from the peaceful wilderness
to the village boundary for the sake of those to be trained.

Though dwelling in deepest tranquillity you were caused by your devotion to Pity to set foot
in the arts of a singer.

The magic, the Lion's Roars, the displays of your own qualities, these were the whetstone-rubbings
from Pity's gold in you who had spewed out the activity of desire.

Ever beneficent on behalf of others while cruel to her own master, to you alone, O Lord, was
Pity pitiless.

For so it was that resolute Pity did sometimes cut you into a hundred pieces and cast you like
an offering to the quarters in order to accomplish others' welfare.

But clearly Pity is virtuous and acts in accordance with your will; for although thus injuring
you she does not offend you.
