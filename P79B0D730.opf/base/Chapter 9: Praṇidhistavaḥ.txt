Praise of the Vow

To hear you brings satisfaction, to see you brings tranquillity, your speech refreshes, your
teaching liberates.

Your birth rejoices the people, your growth delights them, your activity benefits, your ceasing
destroys.

The celebration of you takes sin away, the remembrance brings happiness, the seeking gives understanding,
the full knowledge purifies.

In approaching you is fortune, in honouring you exceeding wisdom, in worshipping you freedom
from fear, in serving you prosperity.

You are a great lake of merit, pure through perfect conduct, calm through perfect meditation,
unshakable through perfect wisdom.

Your form is a jewel to see, your fair speech a jewel to hear, your Law a jewel to ponder; for
you are a mine bearing jewels of merit.

You are the island of those swept along by the waves, the defence of the stricken in spirit,
the refuge of them who fear existence, the resource of them who desire release.

To all living things you are a good vessel because of your pure conduct, a good field by reason
of the excellence of your fruit, a good friend because of the benefits you confer.

You are dear for your beneficence, charming for your tenderness, altogether beloved for your
gentleness, honoured for all virtues.

You are charming because blameless, lovely for excellence of speech and form, wealth-bringing
from the accomplishment of every aim, propitious because the receptable of virtues.
