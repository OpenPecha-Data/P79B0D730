Praise of Guidance

You admonish the stubborn, you bridle the headstrong, you set straight the crooked, you urge
on the slow-placed, the tamed you put under the yoke, to the vicious you are forbearing;
therefore you are a driver unsurpassed of men as of unbroken horses.

(See previous verse)

In you there is pity for the afflicted, good will toward the happy, compassion for those in
calamity, benevolence to all.

Affection even to the hostile, well-doing even to the fallen, tenderness even to the fierce
- wonderful is this nobility of yours.

If father and mother are acknowledged to be venerable because they are benefactors, what dignity
should then be yours whose beneficence has no limit?

You became as a wall to those standing at the edge of the precipice who, careless of their own
good, are, as it were, their own enemies.

To aid the two worlds and to help pass beyond the world you set the light of wisdom among a
people in darkness.

The activities of gods and men, divided when directed towards sensual pleasures, attained unity
in you, being at one in enjoyment of the Law.

For you have granted this hospitality of the Law unstintingly to all, O Blessed One, without
distinction of birth, age, caste, place, or time.

As if amazed and envious the gods honour with the añjali salute even your disciples in whom
is neither amazement nor envy.

Ah! how brilliant is the arising of a Buddha, cream of the saṃsāra, by whom humanity became
envied of the gods!
